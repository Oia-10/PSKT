# Relationship between the problem-solving theory and PSKT

Due to space limitations, we were unable to fully present the relationship between the problem-solving theory and PSKT in the main text. To address this, we have added a diagram to visually illustrate the correspondence between the components and the theory. In the following text, *italicized* original text from the literature, while **bold text** represents theory names.

 In the problem-solving theory, research on complex problem solving (CPS) defines: [The process of CPS usually consists of different phases : (1) **knowledge acquisition** and (2) goal-oriented **knowledge application**.](https://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/3184) Since problem-solving primarily focuses on the
 process from identification to resolution, and KT also concerns knowledge changes after problem-solving, we added a **knowledge updating** module based on [constructivism](https://books.google.com/books?hl=zh-CN&lr=&id=-pIbAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT9&dq=+CatherineTwomeyFosnot.2013.Constructivism:Theory,perspectives,andpractice.++TeachersCollegePress&ots=tzLbOVixEF&sig=WFLh2bK7mLXbkOmZxaqIlrgP8BI#v=onepage&q&f=false).


- **Knowledge Acquisition**: *[In order to sufficiently 【understand the problem &#9312;】
, a problem solver has to systematically generate infor-mation, to sufficiently integrate this information into a viable mentalmodel of the situation, and to selectively 【focus on most relevant,central and urgent aspects &#9313;】 of the problem ](https://doi.org/10.1787/9789264273955-en)*. **[Problem Space](https://doi.org/10.1037/h0030806)** relates to &#9312; and **[Information Reduction](https://doi.org/10.1006/cogp.1996.0009)** relates to &#9313;.

- **Knowledge Application**: *[The problem solver has to make a set of interdependent decisions and to 【 continuously monitor prerequisites and consequences of these decisions &#9314;】in order to systematically 【solve the problem &#9315;】 at hand](https://doi.org/10.1787/9789264273955-en).* We simulate &#9315; using IRT.

- **Knowledge Updating**: **[Constructivism theory](https://books.google.com/books?hl=zh-CN&lr=&id=-pIbAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT9&dq=+CatherineTwomeyFosnot.2013.Constructivism:Theory,perspectives,andpractice.++TeachersCollegePress&ots=tzLbOVixEF&sig=WFLh2bK7mLXbkOmZxaqIlrgP8BI#v=onepage&q&f=false)** emphasizes that learning is an active process of 【constructing knowledge &#9316;】. Additionally, the **[forgetting curve theory](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-934613-64-4.50052-9)** suggests that students' proficiency in knowledge may 【decrease due to forgetting &#9317;】.
